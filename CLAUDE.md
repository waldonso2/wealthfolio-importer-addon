# Trade Republic Importer Addon

Wealthfolio addon that maps Trade Republic CSV exports to Wealthfolio activities. The core logic lives entirely in `src/transform.ts`; the React pages are thin wrappers that call the SDK.

## Quick Start (Claude Code Contributors)

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm test:watch           # Run tests in watch mode while developing
pnpm type-check           # Check TypeScript types
pnpm build                # Build to dist/addon.js
pnpm bundle               # Build + create ZIP for local Wealthfolio installation testing
```

All business logic is in `src/transform.ts` — tests live in `src/transform.test.ts` with CSV fixtures in `src/__fixtures__/`. Start there to understand how transactions are mapped.

## Stack

- **Runtime / package manager**: Node 24, pnpm 11 (versions pinned in `.tool-versions`)
- **Build**: Vite 8 — outputs a single `dist/addon.js` (ES module, no zip)
- **Tests**: Vitest 4 — unit tests in `src/transform.test.ts` + CSV fixture in `src/__fixtures__/`
- **Type checking**: `tsc --noEmit`

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/transform.ts` | Pure CSV-row → ActivityImport mapping; all business logic |
| `src/transform.test.ts` | Full test suite for transform (unit + fixture integration) |
| `src/__fixtures__/tr-sample.csv` | 14-row fixture covering every supported transaction type |
| `manifest.json` | Addon metadata; `version` here drives the release tag |
| `src/addon.tsx` | Entry point — registers pages and sidebar item via addon-sdk |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Full architecture (German): modules, data flow, invariants, change recipes |

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # install deps
pnpm type-check       # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test             # vitest run (once)
pnpm test:watch       # vitest (watch mode)
pnpm build            # vite build → dist/addon.js
pnpm bundle           # build + zip → dist/trade-republic-importer-addon.zip (for local install testing)
pnpm dev              # vite build --watch
```

## Releasing

The release workflow never bumps the version itself — it only creates a GitHub release when `manifest.json`'s version has no matching git tag yet, so a merge to `main` without a version bump runs CI but publishes nothing. This is the deliberate gate for "only release on real changes": whenever a change to this addon touches actual logic (anything under `src/`, `manifest.json` permissions/metadata, transaction-mapping behavior, etc.) rather than just docs/CI/README, **proactively propose a semver bump** (patch/minor/major, with reasoning) before merging — don't wait to be asked. Docs-only or pipeline-only changes should merge without a bump.

Once a bump is agreed, apply it by bumping the `version` field in **both** `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, then push/merge to `main`. The release workflow will:

1. Run type-check, tests, and `pnpm bundle`
2. Detect the new version tag doesn't exist yet
3. Create a GitHub release `v{version}` with the changelog section, `dist/trade-republic-importer-addon.zip` (the installable package), and `dist/addon.js` attached

This addon is registered in the wealthfolio-addons community registry as an unverified directory listing (discovery only, no in-app one-click install) — end users always install manually from the GitHub release zip, per the flow documented in `README.md`.

## Two-account model

Trade Republic uses:
- **Cash account** — deposits, withdrawals, dividends, fees, card transactions
- **Portfolio account** — security positions

Buying a stock moves funds Cash → Portfolio (TRANSFER_OUT / TRANSFER_IN pair) then records the BUY. Selling is the reverse. This pairing is required by Wealthfolio to keep account balances consistent.

## Internal transfers and spending

Every TRANSFER_OUT/TRANSFER_IN pair `transform.ts` generates for an internal movement (BUY funding, SELL/DIVIDEND cash sweep, or a matched Transfer Pattern with a `destinationAccountId`) is tagged with a shared `transferGroupId` (see `ActivityImportEx` in `src/types.ts`). `ImportPage.tsx` forwards that value as `sourceGroupId` on the `ActivityCreate`/`ActivityUpdate` calls it makes — this addon submits activities one at a time via `ctx.api.activities.create()`/`.update()`, never through Wealthfolio's bulk-import pipeline, so Wealthfolio's own transfer-pair auto-linker never runs; without an explicit `sourceGroupId` these pairs get miscounted as spending. `ActivityImport` (the type `transform()` returns) has no `sourceGroupId` field, and `ctx.api.activities.checkImport()` drops unknown fields, so `transferGroupId` can't ride through that round-trip — `ImportPage.tsx` re-derives it by `lineNumber` (which does survive `checkImport`) from the pre-check `transform()` output. Any new internal-transfer pair added to `transform.ts` must get its own `transferGroupId` or it will silently inflate spending.

Only **outbound** CASH types (`CUSTOMER_OUTBOUND_REQUEST`, `TRANSFER_OUTBOUND`/`TRANSFER_INSTANT_OUTBOUND`, `TRANSFER_DIRECT_DEBIT_INBOUND`) check `transferPatterns` — they default to spend (`WITHDRAWAL`) unless matched to a pattern with a `destinationAccountId`, at which point they become an internal transfer. **Inbound** CASH types (`CUSTOMER_INBOUND`/`CUSTOMER_INPAYMENT`, `TRANSFER_INBOUND`/`TRANSFER_INSTANT_INBOUND`) are intentionally always `DEPOSIT` with no pattern check — an unrecognised inbound transfer is treated as external income by design, not matched against your own accounts. Keep new CASH types consistent with this outbound/inbound split rather than adding pattern-matching to inbound types.

## Security mapping persistence

`AddonSettings.securityMappings` (ISIN → `SecurityMapping`) is persisted alongside the rest of the addon config via `settings.ts`. `ImportPage.tsx` pre-fills the mapping step from it on every upload and, if every ISIN in the file is already known, skips `SecurityMappingStep` entirely and goes straight to `checkImport` — so a repeat import of a previously-mapped security requires no user interaction. New mappings (including "custom") are written back to settings as soon as the user completes the mapping step. Because the skip path bypasses the per-import "Clear" button, `SettingsPage.tsx` exposes a list of saved mappings with per-entry removal so a wrong mapping can be corrected without re-importing.
