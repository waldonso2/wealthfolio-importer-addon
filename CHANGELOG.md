# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Update hint: once a day the addon checks the latest GitHub release and, if it is newer than the installed version, shows the version and the download address of `broker-importer-addon.zip` above the Import and Settings pages. Wealthfolio's sandbox doesn't let addons open external links, so the address is shown for copying. Installing stays manual via Settings → Add-ons → Install from File, which keeps your settings.
- New permission `network` (`request`), limited to `api.github.com`. Wealthfolio asks you to approve the host on install; without approval the addon works as before, just without the hint.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Re-importing a file recognised every existing activity as a duplicate except BUY and SELL, so trades were imported a second time. Wealthfolio's duplicate fingerprint includes the trade's exact final cash amount, which it derives (quantity × unit price ± fee) when an activity is created without one, while `checkImport` hashes the amount as submitted. Trades now carry exactly that derived amount, so already imported trades — including those from earlier versions — are detected as duplicates.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- The ticker search in the security-mapping step now starts with the security's name instead of its ISIN (falling back to the ISIN when the CSV has no name). For securities that appear several times, the most recent name from the file is used, since exports can carry outdated names for older rows.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **Breaking:** renamed to **Broker Importer**. The addon ID changed from `trade-republic-importer` to `broker-importer` (routes are now `/addon/broker-importer/…`), the npm package to `broker-importer-addon`, and the release asset to `broker-importer-addon.zip`. Wealthfolio treats this as a new addon: uninstall the old one and re-enter the settings (accounts, transfer patterns, security mappings). Already imported activities are not affected.
- Repository links now point to `waldonso2/wealthfolio-importer-addon`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Scalable Capital transaction exports (`scalable_transactions_export_<date>_de.csv`) can now be imported alongside Trade Republic. The format is detected from the CSV header; Scalable uses its own cash/securities account pair, configured in Settings.
- Supported Scalable types: Kauf, Verkauf, Dividende, Zinsen, Einlage, Entnahme (with transfer-pattern keywords), TAX, Steuerrückerstattung, FEE, fund liquidations (SWAP_OUT) and certificate redemptions. Dividend cancellations, depot-migration transfers and the migration's cash leg are netted and listed as skipped, so holdings and cost basis stay correct. Times are converted from Europe/Berlin to UTC.

### Changed

- Addon name, sidebar label ("Broker Import") and texts now cover both brokers. The addon `id` is unchanged, so existing installations and settings keep working.
- Shared activity helpers moved from `transform.ts` to `common.ts` (no behavior change for Trade Republic imports).

## [1.3.4] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Cash activities were treated as securities when the cash account's currency was not EUR: `ImportPage` compared symbols against a hardcoded `$CASH-EUR`, while the transform emits `$CASH-<cash currency>`. Such cash activities showed up in the security-mapping step and had ticker mappings applied to them. Cash symbols are now recognised for any currency.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Bumped `vite` (7→8), `@vitejs/plugin-react` (4→6), `typescript` (5→6), `@types/node` (20→24, matching the pinned Node 24 runtime), `papaparse` (5.6.1→5.7.0), and pnpm (10→11). Verified `dist/addon.js` still externalizes host-provided dependencies correctly under vite 8's new Rolldown-based bundler. No behavior changes — type-check, tests, and build all pass unmodified.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Bumped the Wealthfolio host SDK family (`@wealthfolio/addon-sdk`, `@wealthfolio/ui`, `@wealthfolio/addon-dev-tools`) from 3.6.1 to 3.7.0, and refreshed other in-range dependencies (`papaparse`, `react`/`react-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `vitest`, and associated type packages). `manifest.json`'s `sdkVersion` and `hostDependencies` are updated to match. No behavior changes — type-check, tests, and build all pass unmodified.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` to check for dependency updates monthly.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Navigating between Import and Settings could silently stop working (clicking the tab did nothing) after the sandbox iframe migration in 1.2.0. Each route was creating its own React root, but the sandbox hands every route the same DOM container — the second `createRoot()` call collided with the still-live first one and its output was never shown. All routes now share a single root, as the SDK's own pattern expects.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Security mappings (ISIN → ticker or "custom") are now persisted across imports. Once a security is resolved, future imports of the same ISIN skip the mapping step entirely. Settings gained a "Security mappings" section to review or clear saved mappings.

### Fixed

- Uploading a non-CSV file (e.g. a zip) is now rejected before parsing, instead of producing confusing results from misread binary content.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Migrated to Wealthfolio Addon SDK 3.6.1. Wealthfolio 3.6 runs addons in an isolated sandbox iframe — routes now render via `ctx.router.add({ render })` into a host-provided DOM node instead of the old `component: React.lazy(...)` pattern, and React/ReactDOM are imported directly (`react`, `react-dom/client`) instead of via SDK re-exports. The sidebar icon is now a host-drawn icon name (`bank`) instead of a custom SVG. No user-facing behavior changes.
- `manifest.json` now declares `minWealthfolioVersion` (3.6.0) and `hostDependencies`; the build externalizes `react`, `react-dom`, `@wealthfolio/addon-sdk`, and `@wealthfolio/ui` as ESM imports instead of bundling them with global-variable mapping.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Internal transfers (BUY funding, SELL/DIVIDEND cash sweeps, and matched Transfer Pattern pairs) no longer inflate Wealthfolio's spending totals. Each `TRANSFER_OUT`/`TRANSFER_IN` pair is now tagged with a shared `sourceGroupId`, which Wealthfolio's spending calculator uses to recognise the pair as an internal transfer rather than an expense.
- `CUSTOMER_OUTBOUND_REQUEST` (withdrawal requests to your linked bank account) now checks Transfer Patterns like `TRANSFER_OUTBOUND` already did — previously it was unconditionally recorded as a `WITHDRAWAL` even when a matching pattern with a destination account was configured, always counting it as spending.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Settings: account dropdowns now filter by type — cash selector shows only CASH accounts, securities selector shows only SECURITIES accounts
- Settings: account names in dropdowns now display their currency for easier identification
- Multi-currency support: cash account currency is captured from the selected account and used throughout the transform (symbol `$CASH-{CURRENCY}`, activity `currency` field) — no longer hardcoded to EUR

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Import Trade Republic CSV exports (cash and portfolio activities)
- Two-account model: separate cash and portfolio accounts
- Automatic detection and mapping of internal fund transfers
- Security mapping step for unrecognised TR symbols
- Settings page for account selection and transfer pattern management
- Support for dividends, withholding tax, buy/sell, deposits, withdrawals, card transactions, interest, and Saveback

### Fixed

- All BUY, SELL, and TRANSFER_IN (broker transfer) activities imported as committed, not as drafts
- Activity deduplication: appends microsecond-precision time tag to every activity comment so that same-merchant/same-amount transactions (e.g. recurring card charges, ETF plan buys at the same price) are no longer collapsed into a single entry by Wealthfolio's idempotency key
